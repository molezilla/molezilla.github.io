										<h2 class="major">The Data</h2>
										<p>
										The data proved too large and unwieldy for any computer we could find to handle. The convenient parsing of R dataframes we all so enjoy, we quickly learned, is
										due to their sizable memory overhead. The smallest cross-item-type dataset yielded a dataframe that exceeded our 16gb RAM limitation. Because of this, we couldn't operate on the 100-million-odd reviews we had hoped to.
										Our group lacked access to a computer with the sufficient RAM to handle any but the smallest datasets. Fortunately, this still left millions and millions
										of reviews for us to parse; given time constraints (parsing is extremely slow) we were able to process 12,985,172 reviews. By any metric,
										this is still a significant number.

										<h2 class="major">Issues</h2>
										<p>
										The data presented to us was in a modified JSON- raw data from Amazon's API isn't in a standard format. It needed to be parsed into JSON in Python first,
										then we were able to convert from there into R dataframes with pre-existing R applications. We ran into a major issue, though, because apparently some reviews made it
										into the JSON data with internal quotes in the review text, and failed to be escape-charactered out. This led to totally unreadable files, and as far as we were able
										to determine, it's not an issue that we possessed the resources to overcome. The only other issue our group encountered was timing- with full courseloads and limited
										computer resources, our group wasn't able to devote the days at a time it took to parse through all of the data piecemeal. This severely limited the scope of conclusions we were
										able to draw from the data.

										<h2 class="major">Our Approach</h2>
										<p>
										After looking into alternative methods of determining whether reviews were incentivized, our final decision, rather than any bulky natural language processing
										algorithm, was to simply GREP reviews based on simple strings with commonly-used phrases in incentivized reviews. Since customers who are offered discounts are
										required to state it, this turned out to be a reasonably effective search pattern. With this style of filtering, the only way to ensure accuracy is manual sampling
										of the flagged data. Every time we refined a dataframe into incentivized reviews only, we manually checked 30 reviews to make sure the customer had really mentioned
										being incentivized. We found a 98.3% accuracy rate with this method. We didn't bother checking the non-incentivized dataset; there wouldn't be enough contamination to
										effect the average review in any significant way.
